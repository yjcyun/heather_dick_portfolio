    text: `Thank you so very much for the experience of your all-weekend "Comedy Is Siriusly Fun" workshop this past weekend. It brought back a lot of great memories of the courses I used to take with you in the late 80's early 90's, and the acting skills I learned from you back then provided a solid foundation that I've been building on in the intervening years.You were able to put each person at ease and get them over their initial discomfort, so they could concentrate on learning.I could see a lot of "a-ha" moments for people, as you tied each game, improv and exercise back to logical and sensible acting concepts that they could identify with and reproduce.Everyone commented on how practical your advice was, and were grateful that you were breaking it down for them to such manageable and learnable steps(I took 9 pages of notes!).`,
